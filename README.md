# Eda-Accident-analysis-Project
Project Overview:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Accident Analysis dataset to uncover insights, patterns, and trends related to traffic accidents. The dataset typically contains information about accidents, such as location, time, weather conditions, causes, severity, and other relevant factors. By performing EDA, we aim to identify key variables that influence the frequency and severity of accidents, discover hidden patterns, and create visualizations that make it easier to understand the underlying data.

Objective:
The main objectives of this project include:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Data Exploration: Analyze the features of the dataset to understand the distribution, correlations, and trends.
Visualization: Create informative visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to present the findings.
Insights & Recommendations: Provide actionable insights to improve traffic safety, inform policy decisions, and suggest possible interventions
Tools and Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python (for data manipulation and visualization)
Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical analysis
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for basic machine learning (optional)
Plotly for interactive visualizations (optional)
Expected Deliverables:
Data Cleaning Report: Document detailing how missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers were handled.
Exploratory Data Analysis Report: A comprehensive report summarizing findings from descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights.
Visualization Dashboard: Interactive or static visualizations summarizing accident patterns, time trends, and correlations.
Insights & Recommendations: A section discussing key findings and recommendations based on the analysis, such as:
High-risk times or locations for accidents.
The role of weather conditions in accident frequency.
Strategies to improve road safety based on the identified patterns.
